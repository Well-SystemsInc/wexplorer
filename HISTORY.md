`{Well}` Systems Inc. was founded on the remains of the (formerly) non-profit `Scarlet Preservation Project`. Following the Mother Computer's destruction, its code and data were split into tens of thousands of so-called `Shards`, which travelled through space-time. The goal of the `Scarlet Preservation Project` was reprogramming the `Shards` to turn them into something useful on their own. However, it was eventually abandoned due to a lack of funding.
